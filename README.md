i need to separate the trading strategies into their own individual branches, pick a branch, inside it the strategy will have a comment with its scores, and its primary strategy.
main is what is submitted
just edit the strategy however you want, commit a new version of the strategy each and every single time you backtest it using backtester.py
if you want to back test your strat, just save the script locally, dont commit it, run backtester.py and then commit with whatever scores it gets.
update this readme with the scores for each strategy and its best score so far. 
need help, please ask me - dont be overly fussed about fucking up the repo, i have a backup
